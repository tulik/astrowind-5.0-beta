# ðŸš€ AstroWind updated to 5.0

**AstroWind** is a free and open-source template to make your website using **[Astro 5.0+](https://astro.build/) + [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**. Ready to start a new project and designed taking into account web best practices.

This is a fork of the original AstroWind template that has been updated to work with Astro 5.0.

## Getting started

**AstroWind** tries to give you quick access to creating a website using [Astro 5.0+](https://astro.build/) + [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). It's a free theme which focuses on simplicity, good practices and high performance.

Very little vanilla javascript is used only to provide basic functionality so that each developer decides which framework (React, Vue, Svelte, Solid JS...) to use and how to approach their goals.

### Project structure

Inside **AstroWind** template, you'll see the following folders and files:

```

â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ MarkdownLayout.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ PageLayout.astro

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config.yaml
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ navigation.js
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ astro.config.ts
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory if they do not require any transformation or in the `assets/` directory if they are imported directly.
